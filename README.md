# creative mode

some initial explorations connecting [react-three-fiber](https://inspiring-wiles-b4ffe0.netlify.app/) and [tensorflow.js posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) for realtime, reactive motion capture? idk it's kinda fun

you can also drag and drop GLTF files from the [three.js editor](https://threejs.org/editor/) or elsewhere
